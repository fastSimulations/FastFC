  "body": "### Open Source Fuel Cell Model and Simulation Suite\r\nFAST and FAST-FC are an open-source simulation and modeling toolbox for PEM and Solid Oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers and batteries.  The FAST fuel cell module is known as FAST-FC (FAST for Fuel Cells) and provides a performance and durability simulation toolbox that allows the user to understand steady-state, transient, and various degradation modes that are critical to unit cell, stack, and system design.  FAST-FC also includes the capability to simulate drive-cycles, ASTs, and diagnostic methods such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).\r\n\r\n### Our Goal\r\nWe are focussed on providing an open-source fuel cell simulation software that provides a development environment for fuel cell developers.  Current development on the FAST platform is focused on extending the platform to include additional aspects of fuel cell operation and durability, such as polymer membrane degradation, and growing the source code to include functionality for battery applications, including the performance and durability of electrode design during charge/discharge cycles.\r\n\r\n### FAST-FC Features\r\nFAST-FC offers the user a fully open-source fuel cell simulation package with the following features:\r\n* Zero license costs coupled with a scalable, parallel architecture\r\n* Full dimensionality from 1-D to 3-D\r\n* Transient and Steady-state operation modes\r\n* Fully coupled physics with composition-based inputs that match the procedures in the lab\r\n* Single-Phase and Two-phase descriptions for water by-products\r\n* Mechanisms for electrocatalyst dissolution, migration, and plating, as well as for electrocatalyst support oxidation and corrosion \r\n* Capability to simulate Accelerated Stress Tests for electrocatalysts and electrocatalyst supports \r\n* An open-source code promoting customization and research\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe original concept for FAST-FC was born in 2002 during David Harvey's Master's degree at Queen's University.  Faced with the limitations of commercial software in meeting the needs of cutting edge fuel cell design and fabrication, David (at the behest of his academic supervisors, Jon Pharoah and Kunal Karan) began the work on the base source code; including the equations and algorithms that laid the foundation for the FAST simulation suite.  David further the work on FAST during his doctorate work, funded by the United States Department of Energy and Ballard Power Systems.  These efforts added capability to simulate electrocatalyst and support material durability to the source code.  Since its initial conception in 2002, FAST-FC remains a dedicated open-source project released under the GNU Public License Version 3.\r\n\r\n### Support for Fast-FC\r\nHaving trouble with Fast-FC or this page?
