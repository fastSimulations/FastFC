<p>FAST and FAST-FC are an open-source simulation and modeling toolbox for PEM and Solid Oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers and batteries.  The FAST fuel cell module is known as FAST-FC (FAST for Fuel Cells) and provides a performance and durability simulation toolbox that allows the user to understand steady-state, transient, and various degradation modes that are critical to unit cell, stack, and system design.  FAST-FC also includes the capability to simulate drive-cycles, ASTs, and diagnostic methods such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).</p>

<a id="our-goal" class="anchor" href="#our-goal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Our Goal</h3>

<p>We are focussed on providing an open-source fuel cell simulation software that provides a development environment for fuel cell developers.  Current development on the FAST platform is focused on extending the platform to include additional aspects of fuel cell operation and durability, such as polymer membrane degradation, and growing the source code to include functionality for battery applications, including the performance and durability of electrode design during charge/discharge cycles.</p>

<p>The original concept for FAST-FC was born in 2002 during David Harvey's Master's degree at Queen's University.  Faced with the limitations of commercial software in meeting the needs of cutting edge fuel cell design and fabrication, David (at the behest of his academic supervisors, Jon Pharoah and Kunal Karan) began the work on the base source code; including the equations and algorithms that laid the foundation for the FAST simulation suite.  David further the work on FAST during his doctorate work, funded by the United States Department of Energy and Ballard Power Systems.  These efforts added capability to simulate electrocatalyst and support material durability to the source code.  Since its initial conception in 2002, FAST-FC remains a dedicated open-source project released under the GNU Public License Version 3.</p>
